## Synopsis

A HTML5 version of Jeopardy using Javascript, JQuery, JSON, and Bootstrap. 

## Code Example

Use board.json for sample input. Use that format when loading the game.

## Motivation

At PAX East 2014, the PowerPoint version of Jeopardy used for Game Show night vomited all the answers, so I thought that there has to be a better HTML5 version of this so that it works.

## Installation

Host on a website. Images should be located on the host server but referenced in the game JSON file.

## TODO

- Add sounds for time up, final jeopardy, and daily double
